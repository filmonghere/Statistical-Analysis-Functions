This is a general wrapper that performs a few statistical analysis tests on tab-delimited files with a header. It is meant to run on unix environments.

The statistical tests currently performed are:
-PCA
-Kmeans Clustering
-Hierarchical Clustering

There are additional scripts in the package which aren't used by default because they require special R packages to be downloaded.

The plots are output into PDF files in the CWD. The warnings and interim data structures are printed to STDOUT.
